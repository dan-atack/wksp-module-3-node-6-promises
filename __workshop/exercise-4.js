// Exercise 4 - `getCurrentTemperature`
// -----------------------------------
// While it's useful to get the current temperature for a specific lat/lng,
// most often we want to provide the name of a place instead.
// 
// You already created a function that can do address ==> position,
// and one that can do position ==> temperature. For this exercise,
// re-use these two functions to create one that goes directly from address ==> temperature.
// 
// You can copy/paste your code from the previous exercises,
// or require them at the top of this file.
// Remember to _export_ them from their file, if you plan on _requiring_ them.

const { getAddressPosition } = require('./exercise-2');
const { getCurrentTemperatureAtPosition } = require('./exercise-3');

// Given an address as a string, returns the temperature
// Use the getCurrentTemperatureAtPosition function
function getCurrentTemperature(address) {
    getAddressPosition(address)
        .then(getCurrentTemperatureAtPosition)
        .then(output => { 
            console.log(`Temperature: ${output.currentTemp} degrees Fahrenheit`);
            // added this to test if the data was moving all the way and not just being console logged... It was helpful to me lol.
            return output.currentTemp;
        })
        .catch(error => console.log("Anh, you fucked up somewhere."))
};

getCurrentTemperature("1455 Boulevard de Maisonneuve O, Montr√©al, QC H3G 1M8");
